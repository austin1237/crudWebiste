===========
A few notes...

This was an extremley early interpretation of how angular could interact with an api via $http. The calls are hard coded to send there values to localhost:3000

Also the links are hardcoded which means for this project to work properly its must be in the root folder of a webserver.

The factory Data should be subsituted to use session data.

The number of controllers should be lessened. For instance each controller probably could be brought into a single controller.

The partial views add/edit are redundent.
